# Simple Python Calculator
A clean, functional command-line calculator built with Python.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Error handling: Prevents crashes on division by zero or invalid text input.
- Persistent loop: Perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Download `calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt.
4. Run the command: `python calculator.py`

## What I Learned
Through this project, I practised:
- Functional programming in Python.
- Using `while` loops for continuous user interaction.
- Implementing `try/except` blocks for robust error handling.
